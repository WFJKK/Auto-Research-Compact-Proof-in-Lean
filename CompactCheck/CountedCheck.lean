# The checker, with its bill: `cost-v3` for proof files

`checkProofCounted` certifies exactly what `checkProof` certifies (it calls it) and charges what the
Python checker charges for the same proof, operation by operation, as `core/check/cost.py` and the charge
sites of `core/check/evaluate.py`, `approx.py` and `checker.py` define it. The bill is computed from the
shapes of the (contracted) graph, the boxes of the leaves and the forms of the approximations, by the
same formulas. The gate for this file is reproduction: on every proof file the pipeline has checked, the
bill here equals the Python length to the unit (`scripts/test_cost.py`).

Soundness is `check_sound`: the count is `checkProof`'s. The bill does not affect it.

Categories, as the Python checker names them: `read`, `extract`, `contract`, `approximate`, `tree`,
`single`, `interval`, `symmetry`.

This file uses only core Lean.

/-! ## The contract rule's charges

Python multiplies the chain's matrices in the cheapest order (a matrix-chain dynamic programme over the
dimensions) and charges `a * b * c` per product, then pushes the biases through, input side first, at one
matrix-vector product each and one vector addition per bias. The composition in `Contract.lean` goes left
to right; the product is the same, so only the charge follows the cheapest order here. -/

/-- The dimensions `d_0, ..., d_k` of a chain of maps with shapes `[d_1, d_0], ..., [d_k, d_{k-1}]`, input
