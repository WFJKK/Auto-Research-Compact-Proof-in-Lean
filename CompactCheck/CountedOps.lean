# The counted language, as an interface: a checker is written for every interpreter

A scored checker is a function of an interpreter `I : Interp`: abstract numbers `I.V`, abstract booleans
`I.B`, abstract counts `I.N`, in an abstract monad `I.M`, with every operation on a number or a truth
value charged by the interpreter. There is no branching on a truth value: it can only become a count, a
choice between two numbers, or another truth value through a charged gate. Because the checker has to
make sense for every `I`, and no operation hands a value of `I.V`, `I.B` or `I.N` back to its own Lean
code in a form it can inspect, nothing the checker learns about the network can change what its own code
does next: whatever it learns stays in the interpreter's hands, and the bill the interpreter keeps is the
whole cost of the computation.

Counts are terminal. The operations that make a count are `nzero`, `nsucc`, `nadd`, `nofNat` (concrete
numbers, free), `countB` and `nscale` (a concrete multiple of one truth value, free); no operation takes a
count together with a truth value or a number, and none takes a count and returns anything but a count.
So every count a checker builds is a sum of concrete numbers and concrete multiples of truth values that
charged operations produced, and the size of a count never encodes a computation on the network: a
product of two truth values exists only through a charged gate. This closes the holes of the three earlier
versions: concrete booleans (bits rebuilt into numbers by free arithmetic), branching into the checker's
own code (a reviewer's `I.ifN bit (k 1) (k 0)`), and a free mask `nmask : B → N → N` on an arbitrary count
(a reviewer's decision tree `nadd (nmask b (k 1)) (nmask nb (k 0))`, a conditional on counts for nothing).

`Interp.counting` is the interpreter the service runs: `CostM` of `Counted.lean`, with `Q`, `Bool` and `Nat`.
A submission's soundness theorem and instance theorem are about `D Interp.counting` (docs/COUNTED.md); the
service checks that the checker's own code never mentions `Interp.counting`, `CostM` or `Q`
(`accept/allowlist.txt`), so that the abstraction is real.

The counted operations `CostM.single` and `CostM.interval` run a rule of the proved checker and charge what
`cost-v3` charges for it, through the formulas of `CountedCheck.lean`; `Interp.counting` offers them as
`single` and `interval`. Every operation of the counting interpreter has its specification lemma, so a
soundness proof never looks inside the monad.

This file uses only core Lean.

/-- An interpreter of the counted language. A checker is a function of one of these: it can use the
    operations below and ordinary Lean on lists, `Nat` indices and strings, and nothing else about `M`,
    `V`, `B` or `N`. The charges named are those of `Interp.counting`. -/
structure Interp : Type 1 where
  /-- The monad of the computation. -/
  M : Type → Type
  monad : Monad M
  /-- A number of the network or the certificate, or computed from them. -/
  V : Type
  /-- A truth value computed from numbers. -/
  B : Type
  /-- A count of inputs, computed from truth values. -/
  N : Type
  /-- Entry `i` of the weight `name`, in row-major order. Free: the weights are charged once per
      proof (`extract`, E). -/
  weight : String → Nat → M V
  /-- The shape of a weight, for loops. Free. -/
  weightShape : String → M (List Nat)
  /-- The number of entries of a weight (its data length). Free: structural metadata, like the shape. With
      it a checker establishes that a tensor is well formed (length equals the product of the shape) by a
      concrete comparison, instead of paying a forward pass for it. -/
  weightSize : String → M Nat
  /-- Number `i` of the certificate. Free: the certificate is charged once per proof (`read`). -/
  cert : Nat → M V
  /-- How many numbers the certificate holds. Free. -/
  certSize : M Nat
  /-- A numeral, as a number read from the proof file: 1. -/
  lit : String → Nat → M V
  /-- Zero, free: the Python checker starts its sums at 0 without charge. -/

  neg : String → V → M V

  max : String → V → V → M V
  /-- Comparisons, 1 each: the only source of truth values about numbers. -/
  lt : String → V → V → M B
  le : String → V → V → M B
  eq : String → V → V → M B
  /-- Bounds on `exp a` (`Exp.lean`), charged 3; the monad fails if the argument is out of range. -/
  exp : String → V → M (V × V)
  /-- Add to the bill. A program can only make itself longer. -/

  fail : {α : Type} → M α
  /-- The two constant truth values, free. -/
  btrue : B
  bfalse : B
  /-- What a truth value can become, and nothing else: a count (`countB`: one if true; `nscale k`: the
      concrete `k` if true, else zero), a choice between two numbers (`selectV`, charged 1 like `min`), or
      another truth value through a gate (charged 1 each). There is no branching: a checker's own code
      never learns a truth value, so what it computes next never depends on the network; and no operation
      takes a count together with a truth value, so a count is only ever a sum of concrete multiples of
      truth values (see the header). -/
